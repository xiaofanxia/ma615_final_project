"2",2818,1771,"2009-04-24",12798,"Alice","Daniel is the most amazing host! His place is extremely clean, and he provides everything you could possibly want (comfy bed, guidebooks & maps, mini-fridge, towels, even toiletries). He is extremely friendly and helpful, and will go out of his way to help you if needed, or just let you come and go as you please. Highly recommended!"
"3",2818,1989,"2009-05-03",11869,"Natalja","We had such a great time in Amsterdam. Daniel is an excellent host! Very friendly and everytime helpful. The room was cozy, comfortable, and VERY clean. Maps, towels, mini-fridge, coffee (very tasty) and tea supplies were provided. Bathroom with all the bathroom requires. Good location - next to the tram stop and it took just around 10-15 minutes to get to the city center.
Totally recommendable! "

"5",2818,3151,"2009-05-25",17977,"Sherwin","Daniel is highly recommended.  He provided all necessities (and actually went way beyond what's expected of a great host). His place is very clean.  It is also convenient to buses and trams which will take you around the city in minutes.  You will truly feel like a local here."
"6",2818,4748,"2009-06-29",20192,"Jie","Daniel was a great host! He made everything so easy for us! The room was super clean and well equipped, the beds were very comfortable! Daniel also gave us good advices,  tips and tools (maps, compass, umbrella..) for getting around the city. The place is located in the quiet neighbourhood so we are away from all the noises, but it is also very close to all the public transportations so getting into the city is fairly easy and fast. I highly recommend Daniele's place!

"7",2818,5202,"2009-07-07",23055,"Vanessa","Daniele is an amazing host! He provided everything that was needed to make our stay comfortable and easy! The rooms were clean and cozy; and he took the time to show us how to get around Amsterdam via public transportation or riding around on bicycles. You truly do feel like a local when staying with Daniele!!

"8",2818,9131,"2009-09-06",26343,"Katja","You can´t have a nicer start in Amsterdam. Daniel is such a great and welcoming host. The room was really light and charming, so well decorated. Daniel has a great sense of hospitality, he even helped with our luggage and gave us maps and a travelguide. He´s very open minded and helpful. We had a great time, we would stay with him again anytime we´re back in Amsterdam. Daniel made sure we had everything for a great trip, thanks again for the bikes! Hope to see you soon, Daniel!"
"9",2818,12103,"2009-10-01",40999,"Marie-Eve","Daniel was a fantastic host. His place is calm and clean, and he provided so much information on how to enjoy the amazing city of Amsterdam. Should I return to the city, his place will be my first choice! "
"10",2818,16196,"2009-11-04",38623,"Graham","Daniel was great. He couldn.t do enough for us. He has gone to a lot of trouble and added every little touch to his apartment. He can speak 5 languages so that should not be a problem for anyone.
The accomation had everything we needed and was very convienient to the bus and tram."
"11",2818,18095,"2009-11-23",48138,"Klaus","Daniel has been more then a great host: it was like having an home in Amsterdam!
If friendliness and kindness were not enough, the house was super clean and he provided all the things needed for our staying: maps, timetables, suggestions and tips, even bicycles! The location is easy to get to and from the station and the city center, 24h/24h connection, with a relaxing and serviced neighborhood. And don't worry, he speaks 5 languages if you mind having communication problems. Hope to find other guest like him in the future!"
"12",2818,18286,"2009-11-25",55661,"Michael","Daniel's apartment and room was spotless. Daniel was very friendly throughout our correspondence and was even waiting for me outside his place when I arrived (late). The apartment is very convenient to the center of the city, and an easy walk to the transportation stops. Daniel is well prepared for any guest, providing me with maps and bus schedules. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Daniel is wonderful host."
"13",2818,24925,"2010-01-27",33284,"Araz","Daniel was an exeptional host!! We only had a short stay in Amsterdam but Daniel was extremely helpful as he had all the local transport timetables mapped out and ready for us to use. His place was very clean and comfortable. Daniel was incredibly accommodating on our last day in Amsterdam. Our flight wasn't till the evening and he was kind enough to let us leave our luggage for the day and return to pick them up before our flight. TOTALLY, TOTALLY, TOTALLY recommend Daniel's place next time you visit Amsterdam."
"14",2818,31154,"2010-03-24",82918,"Natalie","No amount of praise for Daniel would be corny or excessive.  His place was comfortable and wonderful, and he is an incredibly friendly and accommodating host.  I felt cleaner, safer, and happier than at any hotel.  A friend and I stayed here, and we loved having the twin beds in the same room.  The shower was luxurious and clean, and Daniel provided us with maps, restaurant recommendations, bikes, and tea service!  I just asked my travel companion ""What else can I say about Daniel's place?"" and he was like, ""OH MAN!  It's one thing to expect breakfast from a B&B, and it's quite another to be chez Daniel.  His command of the nuances of hosting are unmatched."""
"15",2818,35916,"2010-04-16",97200,"Ludovic","It's the perfect place: clean, safe, noiseless, with a perfect owner.  Moreover with the hash from Island, we were stucked in amstedam and daniel help us a lot. So thanks you Daniel. If you have to come to Amsterdam, choose the Daniel's place and you will enjoy your holidays."
"16",2818,36774,"2010-04-19",103149,"Faisal","When you reach at Dainel place, be sure that all things are ready to greet you. May it be meticulously made room or spick & span bathroom or well-thought-of information on ""Things To Do"" along with relevant maps & transportation schedule to explore the city to the fullest. Nothing misses out from Daniel's radar.
His pleasing personality with great asthetic sense is just an icing on the cake.We would definately stay with him again.Thanks again for making us feel at home."
"17",2818,39856,"2010-05-03",112391,"Rickey","Daniel is a terrific host, like one of the other people stated Danile provided me with great maps and recommendations. I would stay with Daniel again anytime. "
"18",2818,45708,"2010-05-24",79479,"David","Daniel was a fantastic host and we would absolutely stay again with him. Everything was as advertised and you can easily get anywhere from his apartment. "
"19",2818,48766,"2010-06-01",99878,"Josh And Alan","Our stay with Daniel was truly one of the highlights of mine and my partner's whirlwind European tour. Not only was the room smashingly decorated (a great example of modern Dutch living), spotlessly clean and serenely comfortable {think Zen), but having Daniel as a point of reference was our key to discovering the city. From the get-go he freely offered advice whenever we had questions about where to go or what to do in Amsterdam. 

The room is located at quite a distance from the heart of the city, but we didn't find this hindering. We were able to get to the center in a snap with the two bikes Daniel has available for a minimal charge or via any of the train or bus stops located within a stones throw of his front door. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and groceries in the area. And staying here is also a great way to see how the locals are living.

I would recommend Daniel's residence to anyone looking for a smart, affordable alternative to hotels or hostels. As a gay couple especially we found him extremely welcoming. 

P.S. You can check my YouTube page for videos of our stay in Amsterdam, which includes a peek into the room: (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
"20",2818,54108,"2010-06-17",131821,"Amelia","Daniel was very accomodating and friendly. It was a little pricey for what it was. The bed was smaller than a dormitory bed, and as a college student, I would know. The neighborhood seemed relatively safe but I did get hassled a few times outside of the apartment. Overall, I was impressed but I probably would stay closer to the city center in the future."
"21",2818,54654,"2010-06-19",97097,"Jenn","Daniel's place was great! We got so much relaxing in. We loved staying there are really appreciated his great hospitality! He gave us great tips on getting around etc. I would recommend his place to anyone traveling to Amsterdam."
"22",2818,58048,"2010-06-27",147769,"Andrew","Just a short note - my first experience with AirBnB was with Daniel and it was stellar.  Exactly as indicated and advertised, the service was exemplary.  As a person who does a lot of business travelling, I found Daniel to be an informed and professional host.  Much better service than harried business travellers normally recieve.  For example he answered many questions about the local transportation, the scene, and the best way to spend our time.  He also arranged for bikes which is undoubtedly the best way to see the city.  I highly recommend Daniel to anyone considering a trip to Amsterdam, the experience was completely positive."
"23",2818,62552,"2010-07-08",15745,"David","Daniel was an exceptional host!  I was primarily happy because of the following 3 characteristics:

1) Friendliness and knowledgeability of the host -- Along with my reservation I received very carefully laid out instructions to arrive at Daniel's doorstep and he was right there waiting for me when and where he said he would be.  One evening Daniel invited me to drink a beer with him and he shared his personal story about arriving in Amsterdam years ago and what attracted him to the city.  We also spent time talking about the culture of Holland and how its position as a trading port influenced the ideals of the city.  Daniel had good recommendations for how and when to see various tourist spots and had some alternative recommendations (local pools, bibliotech (library), etc...).

2) Cleanliness of the place -- Daniel's apartment is spotless.  The particular room was very well cared-for and had all of the accessories needed.

3) All the ""little extras"" -- Daniel opened a fresh pair of slippers for me upon arrival.  He also had a nicely laid out tea/coffee set in the room, 3 different tour books about Amsterdam which helped me plan my days, a plastic map which I could carry throughout the adventures, a bicycle available to rent, matching set of shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom, etc...  an adapter for my US plugs.  Everything was well thought-out and Daniel gave a lot of attention to make sure that the visit was superb."
"24",2818,73222,"2010-08-03",164729,"Michel","Daniel is a great host. He is a very sweet and courteous person and he seems to truly enjoy hosting guests. His apartment is very tidy and clean and it's not often that you come across such a clean and well organized place (you would have to go 4 stars or higher!). He provides everything the guests could think of (or at least that I can think of): bikes, towels, shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, different maps, guides etc. and he will always be of service when information or recommendations are needed. Daniel is very easy to deal with and it was a pleasure to stay with him.
Thank you Daniel."
"25",2818,74084,"2010-08-05",171625,"Lezle","We spent two nights at Daniel's and very much enjoyed it. Early on, he e-mailed very explicit directions on how to reach his home and upon reaching there, he had maps and travel guides handy and was available to answer any questions. The room was quiet, comfortable, and meticulous. His place is a bit out of the central area of Amsterdam, but is easily accessible by tram. It was also nice to be away from the crowds and in a local neighborhood. We would thoroughly recommend his place and would stay again when in the area!"
"26",2818,87063,"2010-08-30",175043,"Andrew","Daniel was an excellent host, and I whole heartedly recommend his accomodations. He is pleasant, the place was very clean, and the location was perfect - a 10-15 minute bus or metro ride to downtown and quiet in the evening. On my next visit to Amsterdam, I would absolutely stay with Daniel again. "
"27",2818,91025,"2010-09-06",105289,"Nadia","Daniel is a fantastic host who cares about the details of his guest's stay in Amsterdam. He was a blessing when it came to getting directions of where we needed to go. He definitely comes excellently-recommended!"
"28",2818,94243,"2010-09-10",202035,"Agam","Daniel's setup was very good.  Like other reviewers have said before, he has a lot of nice little touches and everything is extremely well thought out in providing a seamless experience for his guests.  

Daniel himself was really nice and accommodating.  He helped me figure out all my public transportation needs, weather predictions and requests.

His place is clean and near lots of different tram lines, so you can get pretty much anywhere.  Also he seems to work around your schedule in terms of cleaning the room and letting you use the shower, etc.  So it's just really comfortable in that regard where you don't feel like you are imposing too much.

There are also some food options around his apartment to grab some food late at night which is always handy.  Would definitely stay there agin."
"29",2818,97728,"2010-09-15",211004,"Alexandra","Our stay at Daniel was awesome. He has a beautiful flat which is very tidy and neat. The room to rent is also very nice. It has two comfy beds and a wardrobe. Daniel also provides a private kettel, a range of tea and coffee. There are also towels for which Daniel provides a special space in the bathroom. 
What was outstanding, was that Daniel also lent us two of his bikes. This was most helpful as we hadn't to figure out the public transport and were free to discover Amsterdam by bike. Even if you would have to take the bus or tram the appartment is located idealy to various stops. "

He is always available by phone. The room is well appointed with maps and information to get you around the Amsterdam seamlessly.  The room is nicely decorated and very clean with a armoire for your clothes so you don't need to live out of your suitcase. I would definitely stay at Daniel's again.  I had a great time."
"32",2818,114145,"2010-10-08",224147,"Sylvia","Daniel's place was without a doubt the most rewarding of our trip to Europe. His attention to details and kindness make his place an excellent alternative for those considering a bed and breakfast in Amsterdam
I strongly advise to consider his place: Great location, an affordable price, a clean and organized room and a great host. What else can you ask for?
Thanks Daniel
Hope to see u soon!"

We would definately stay at Daniel's the next time we visit Amsterdam. "
"34",2818,126525,"2010-10-25",241053,"Roberto","Staying st Daniel's was flawless, everything was perfect. Daniel has everything well organized and well planned for the guests. He provides maps and books of Amsterdam, and he is always available for any help you might need.

The room is very quiet, and well decorated, very clean.

I felt very comfortable, I would stay again. "

Daniel is a great host. Always recomendable.

"36",2818,143537,"2010-11-23",54482,"Marta","Me and my boyfriend have spent three nights at Daniel´s place, and we are very pleased with the choice. Daniel is charming, always aware that everything was fine. His house is very nice, very clean and beautiful. The room is very nice and the beds are very comfortable. We had at our disposal free bikes, coffee ant tea, guides, towels, hair dryer...
The only downside is that we couldn´t be much with Daniel, who was a lovely person!
If we go back to Amsterdam we would repeat for sure!
Thank you Daniel!"
"37",2818,161816,"2011-01-01",329040,"Leigh And Stefanie","Daniel provides 5 star service. He is a super nice guy and he is super friendly and well organized. I was traveling with a buddy and everything worked out great. My stay was over a year ago and I only just figured out how to write a review. Happy travels everyone !"
"38",2818,194298,"2011-03-07",374779,"Drew","Daniel's place is a fantastic place to stay in Amsterdam if you expect to be spending (as you should) most or all of your time out and about in the city. It's particularly well-suited to the solo traveller and Daniel is a fantastic host. 

Slightly outside the 'core' of Amsterdam, but transport is extremely convenient and Daniel is hugely accommodating with late-night schedules. 

Only thing I'd say is that it is best if you have experienced what European apartments are actually like. Daniel's is really, really nice - but it IS European. If you're fresh off the plane from North America and have never been to Europe before I'd suggest you get a hotel for a few days first. But I'd say that about any European apartment. 

Hugely enjoyed my time. Highly recommend.  "
"39",2818,196836,"2011-03-11",422476,"Colin","Staying at Daniel's apartment was great! My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights and were very happy to do so. Daniel was a terrific host who made us feel at home. The room we stayed in was lovely and comfortable, and he provided us with a hair dryer, towels, tea and coffee, maps and guide books. He was a wealth of information in terms of when to go to certain museums, what was and wasn't worthwhile, and the best ways to get around using public transportation. He even allowed us to use his bikes free of charge! He was very accommodating and accepted our booking very last minute, and didn't mind that we were arriving late in the evening on a weeknight. The location of his apartment is also great--near both train and bus stops, in a nice, quiet neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend staying here! "
"40",2818,214718,"2011-04-01",442422,"Angela","Daniel's apartment was perfect for my 5 days in Amsterdam (march 2011) and was a great value. It is only 5 minutes away from the bus and is in a safe residential area. The area has public transports, restaurants, laundry, supermarket. The apartment was also very comfortable and very well-equipped. The kitchen, work desk, shower and bathroom were all very nice. It is well maintained, very clean, nicely decorated. The bed is really comfortable, the sheets are soft and fragrant. There were beautiful flowers, tea and hot water inside my room. He has an eye for everything, is friendly and very professional. Daniel arranged everything and advised me before the trip. His manager went well beyond to answer my daily questions, taught me how travel around the city, and was nearby most times or quickly responded to my messages.  In short: go to Amsterdam, rent Daniel's appartment and be happy. Thanks again, Daniel for a great stay! Angela (Brazil)."

"42",2818,260298,"2011-05-12",229991,"Marsha","Daniel is an amazing host!  The room is exceptionally comfortable, very good mattresses, very pretty, light and airy.  There is a tea service area with a small fridge that was very convenient.  The environment was exceptionally clean, organized and Daniel has maps and a wealth of information available for tourists.  He was great at helping us to make arrangements for tourist tickets online.  The most wonderful thing about his location is the neighborhood, especially if you are looking for a local experience.  It was very easy to use the public transit system from his location.  Everything is close.  Daniel offered bikes to use and that was fabulous.  Daniel did everything possible to provide a pleasant experience and we had an amazing time.  I highly recommend Daniel's place.  "

The location is not far by public transport from anything that you might want to do in Amsterdam. Don't hesitate to ask Daniel questions about things to do, how to get there, and especially places to eat. His recommendations are excellent!

We loved our stay in Amsterdam and would gladly stay with Daniel again."

We did not plan much for this trip, but on the first night we could perfectly plan out everything with the resources Daniel provided us. All the travel guides and efficient maps are in the room! 

If you a big fan of Thai food, ask Daniel where to go for your first meal in Amsterdam near his place- it was THE BEST. 

Thank you Daniel!!!

The room is better than the photo and the accomodations were wonderful.  Daniel was great with communication both before and during our stay.  The location has easy access to tram, bus, stores, restaurants, and pubs - all within walking distance. I will definitely stay with Daniel again and I have already recommended his room to family and friends."
"47",2818,369637,"2011-07-12",772352,"David","Daniel is an outstanding host. He is extraordinarily organized & tidy. The room was spotless, and the two beds were comfortable. There is quite a lot of space, and a beautiful view of his backyard garden out the bedroom window. It is so nice to open the windows and see greenery and hear the chirping birds. It is an easy 10-15 minute bike ride to Amsterdam Centraal Station, and all the rest that the city has to offer. Highly recommended! I would definitely stay again."
"48",2818,510827,"2011-09-07",909454,"Yana","Daniels's place is really fantastic and he was a great host! 

His place is beautifully decorated and very clean and no detail is lost to the make the stay very comfortable for his guests. From the latest cover of ""time out amsterdam"" to color coded towel rack for guests, to the most comfortable beds and pillows, latest travel books,  keys for each guest, his place set a high standard of what Airbnb should be like.

Especially grateful for countless hours Daniel put into helping my travel parner with her lost passport/wallet in another country, and having a converter for my mac.

His home was quiet and peaceful, and he has a lovely garden. The bus is a block away, supermarket 2 blocks away, and a great restaurant Bahnus(?) is 2-3 blocks away, serves very good dinner.

Highly recommend his home for exploring Amsterdam. There is a park  about 20 minutes away that's a must see for a flower lover, it's called Oosterpark and it was delightful!"

When we arrived (which was late, and our ETA was changed a few times due to travel woes), our beds were made, clean towels neatly wrapped, soothing music playing, and the smell of fresh eucalyptus/mint filled the air. Overall, a fantastic experience I would recommend to everyone. 

Thanks Daniel!

He has a great place in a quiet neighboorhood with easy access to trams and busses to get to the centraal station in 15 mins. On our arrival he shared a lot of good information about places to visit. We had an extra guest at the last minute and he was more than happy to accommodate  him in the living room. AMS is awesome and would definitely like to visit back and would stay @Daniels again :)"

His home was extremely clean and very well organized. The garden view was so peaceful. Both my bf and myself were sick during our Europe trip and Daniel was kind enough to offer us lozenges for our sore throats. He was also very helpful by providing maps, magazines on things to do and any other advice we needed. The room came equipped with coffee and tea and WiFi. His home is very close to public transportation and getting to central Amsterdam was a breeze. If I ever come back to Amsterdam I would definitely be staying at his place again. "

Daniel was very helpful in giving directions on how to best get to his place with a bit of luggage.  On getting there he gave me directions on how best to get to do what I wanted in the time I had.  He provided privacy though I knew he was there to provide any help he could if needed.  I would recommend his place to my friends.  His place is in a very convenient and safe area.

Our only complaint was that we were not made aware of the early morning check out time upon arrival and came home the night before to a note on the door asking us to be out by a certain time. As long as you get all the information and communication from him, you should be fine.

The apartment itself is incredibly clean, the room is a good size and very easy access to city center, rijksmuseum, vondelpark, and the train station - a 10 minute bus ride. Great wifi, tea and coffee in the room, this was a home away from home and a great first stop on our journey. This is a wonderful stay for 2 people, and I would definitely stay here again!"

Only slight problem we faced was a space issue when opening up multiple suitcases in the same room, but we got used to it soon enough. The room also has a mini-refrigerator - which was of great convenience. The neighborhood this apartment is located in is also very nice. Overall, very comfortable stay!"

His apartment is very quiet and impeccably clean; the bedroom is very nice, exaclty as in the photos (pillows and duvet are very good). Besides, there is a table and a small fridge. The shower (separate from the WC)  is also very good. The apartment is not in the center but you can easily reach it by bus, tram or metro. There are various restaurants, bars and cafés in the area - this is great because you get to know places where tourists usually do not go. 
Daniel is a great host, he provided us with very useful info about transport and things to do in Ams. Our stay was great, we did not have any problem at all in the apartment. I am sure Daniel would provide any further assistance that we may have needed, he really thinks about every tiny thing a tourist may need during his/her stay in Amsterdam. I also wanted to thank him for finding the contact lenses we forgot in the bedroom! Definitely recommend! "

We felt like we are home for 4 nights. He was very kind and helpful.
The room was very clean and quite. And there was a garden out of window in the room. In the every morning, when we woke up, we could see the bird’s tweet with the breeze softly. How can the morning be better?
In the night, the curtains block the light completely during sleeping.
Only alarm could interrupt our sleeping.

The bathroom was also VERY clean. The toiletries were all good stuff.
It was filled with the AROMA. Also, It was good to take a shower with good temperature and water pressure.

First of all, His house is always neat and clean. And he knew everything for the trip in Amsterdam. Also, we had a pleasant conversation with him.
Thank you, Daniel."

I recommend daniel as a host full heartedly.  Brilliant time. Til next time!"
"89",2818,20096728,"2014-09-23",8700764,"Amelia","Daniel was a very helpful host. Upon arrival he was there to welcome us with cold drinks. He provided us with clear directions and maps of Amsterdam. He made it so easy to explore Amsterdam using public transport. He was always available and happy to answer question. He was friendly and talkative and interested in our days. He was very well organised and the apartment was as pictured and spotlessly clean. The bed were very comfortable. I bought some food without realising that guests don't have access to the kitchen (it is written in the room description), Daniel was very generous and still let me use his kitchen to cook my food. We had a little bit of trouble connecting to the internet in the bedroom (was strong in the lounge room) Daniel gave us a signal booster for the bedroom when we let him know. I would recommend staying with Daniel."
"90",2818,20302184,"2014-09-27",10676984,"James","After we arrived Daniel showed us the accommodations and offered us something to drink. We proceeded to talk for the better part of three hours. Daniel is one of the most agreeable and accommodating people I have stayed with through Airbnb. In his apartment are countless books about Amsterdam that one can leaf through. However, if you don't like to read, he can show you places to go and tell you about locales to visit that are not only interesting for tourists but for locals as well. He provides you with numerous maps, so you will never be wanting a reference if you happen to lose your way. It was a warm and informative welcome. 

The accommodations were spectacular. There are ample nooks in which to store your baggage, so what at first appears to be a modestly-sized room for two people with luggage turns out to be rather spacious. The room is equipped with a water heater, instant coffee, and tea, so if the need for a morning pep-up settles upon you, it is right there in your room. Each bed is equipped with a reading lamp and the heater is placed nicely between the heads of the bed. We were never cold. The bathroom and toilet were kept impeccably clean and the towels were washed when we needed them. The orchids throughout the apartment were also very beautiful, and when we wanted some fresh air we needed only to open the window to the garden that is situated between the beds. 

The location of the apartment should suit those who want quick access to the city center without the bustle and noise. If one wishes to go by foot, one can get to the many attractions old city in about 30-45 minutes, depending on how fast one walks. It is an enjoyable city to walk in: very flat, organized, neighborhood markets everyday, different languages and cultures always surrounding you. The apartment itself is in a primarily non-native-Dutch neighborhood, so you're exposed from the get-go to the nice mix of cultures that Amsterdam harbors. The area is quiet but active. Staying here, one also experiences the everyday life of Amsterdam and avoids an environment overly saturated with tourists. There is a school, many shops for locals, and a playground for children in the vicinity. Flevo Park is about a five-minute walk from the apartment, which is nice if you want to spend an afternoon among the storks, swans, and sandy soil upon which Amsterdam is rooted.  

To the host himself: Daniel is helpful. He makes sure you are comfortable and is always open to questions and offering suggestions. He takes care of without meddling over you. You could talk to him not only about Amsterdam but many things: the art in his apartment, the furniture, films, etc. We had no complaints and were very happy to have stayed there. If you wish to visit Amsterdam but avoid the bustle, this is where you should stay."
"91",2818,20503978,"2014-09-30",19381082,"Anna","Daniel was a great host, very attentive and prudent. His appartement was just as shown in the photos, very homely and clean and it smelled very nice and fresh. Hence we really enjoyed staying with him. 


After booking he sent us a nice email with lots of information and responded quickly to our questions.

When we arrived in Amsterdam, we got a phone call from Daniel making sure we found his place okay. He is a calm, very friendly person who is fluent in English. 

Upon arriving in Niasstraat, Anna and I realised that we didn’t know his last name, so we were worried, if we’d find his doorbell. To our surprise, he put his first name on the doorbell which is smart and gives him the benefit of a little more anonymity. 

We were greeted by Daniel at the door who invited us in and offered us something to drink. We were sitting in his living room, which is decorated with African wooden figures, listening to the Pachelbel canon. 
He gave us lots of valuable information, including various maps (public transport, of the neighborhood and whole city), aswell as bus and tram schedules. 

You could tell from every detail that Daniel handles his hosting very professionally: he has a door lock with a key code, which he individually changes for every guest. His WiFi passwort was also changed specifically for our stay. We were positively surprised! 
For security reasons, he also installed an infrared webcam in his hallway, which is okay but he forgot to mention it.

After that he gave us the tour of his appartement. It’s a cozy, very tidy place with a guest room looking at the garden.
There are two beds, on top of each layed two rolled-up towels. They were color-marked red and orange respectively, so we would not confuse them in the bathroom. Another smart detail. 
The room had all the extras as described and seen in the photographs. Daniel cleaned the dishes for us after every time we made tea and also cleaned our waste basket every day. 
WiFi reception was not the best in the bedroom (we used two Android smartphones). Enough for (Hidden by Airbnb) , but not enough for watching YouTube clips. A WiFi repeater in the room would be a good solution to this problem. 

After this he showed us the bathroom. I was amused by a small homo-erotic piece of art attached to the bathroom door. The bathroom, like the rest of the appartment, was very clean, with a nice shower, space for toiletries on the washing machine and color-marked towel bars. The toilet was not in the bathroom, but an own seperate room.


We can highly recommend @Daniel's and if we'll be visting Amsterdam again we would try to stay with him again.


Hartstikke bedankt Daniel!"

The room is absolutely cosy and offers everything one would need. The beds are very comfortable und it's a rather quiet neighbourhood. He provided towels and linen and the whole flat was very tidy.

Aparte de ser una persona encantadora es muy servicial y en todo momento nos facilitó todo tipo de información necesaria para nuestro viaje sea del tipo que sea. Es muy atento y le puedes pedir cualquier cosa, la verdad es que cuida mucho a sus huéspedes y hace que te lleves un gran recuerdo de su casa y de la ciudad, que, por cierto, ánimo a todo el mundo a visitarla.

As soon as we arrived, Daniel showed us around his home and we had a cup of tea.  He told us everything we needed to know and let us ask him any questions we had!! His home is very organized and was color-coordinated as far as towels and bathroom items!  He had bikes for us to rent (13 euro first day, 7 euro each day after) and they were great!! We got to see the city as the locals do and biking was so much fun!! It's difficult to get used to if you don't bike everyday, but it was so much fun! And Daniel told us everything we needed to know about biking in he city! Daniel's home is a 10 minute bike ride into the city which is perfect for any tourist wanting to see the city and an average Dutch neighborhood!

The public transport is very easy to use - roughly a 5 minute walk to the bus stop and a 12 minute bus ride into the city. We had no trouble getting anywhere.

Daniel also made sure to check up on how I am doing throughout my trip - when we had issues communicating by text, he continued to keep in touch via email, which is much appreciated. 

The accommodations are as advertised. The room is cosy and looks out on Daniel's carefully cultivated garden. The lavatory and bathroom, which are separate, are exceptionally clean. The flat itself has close access to the public transit system should you opt not to ride a bike in Amsterdam. All in all, Daniel's flat is the perfect place to rest after a long day of sightseeing in Amsterdam. Highly recommended."

His advice is spot on and as he listens to your interest books magically appear in your room.  The noise from the other residents is non existent.  The design and build obviously intended it this way.  Only noise on my stay were the birds outside my windows which if you weren't paying attention, you'd not even notice.

I relied on his tour map (linking public transportation to main sights) more than my travel guide.  Daniel supplied me with electric water heater in my room so I could consume tea/coffee at my leisure, added some of my laundry to his own, showed me how to use (Hidden by Airbnb) map in real time and supplied me with a lanyard with his phone number (which I never used but was reassuring to have.

A very quiet place to sleep and recharge the phone. Excellent Wifi speed. We found everything in his house was neat and Daniel has the eye for perfection and attention to details. Very well kept garden at the back of the house, immaculate clean toilet and shower.

Daniel gives you plenty of privacy and also is helpful should you need anything. This is a perfect place for someone busy who needs to feel at home after a long day at conference. Very informative guide provided by Daniel, ideal for first time visitors to Amsterdam. Very good neighborhood.

We found it an easy walk to the bus stops and tram stops and not far from the bars and restaurant. It is ideal location for us to go to RAI and also central via Rembrandt Square and Dam Square.

Everything seems perfect and staying in his house really made our journey more memorable. Those detailed surprises shall be revealed by the next lucky ones. Overall, 100% recommended."

His room and service area (bathroom and toilets) are probably  the cleaner on thus planet- I really plan to indicate his name for the Nobel Prize, if the Sweddish Academy opens an airb&b competition... Serioysly now - we enjoyed his place a lot. The mattress of his bed is unbelievable - so confortable (I never trusted soft matresses- my back is very senstive). Riding a bike one can easily reach the central area within 20-30 min depending on your energy and wind factor. Thre is a nice park nearby (7 min). We had a fantastic spring wheather most if the time  (3/4 d) which obviously makes a difference. In two occasions we returned home at 1:15 am - it was safe and  fun.  If you are less lucky and must face cold  rain, the tram and bus are not too far, but you need a strong umbrella (Daniel will provide you if required). In summary - Enjoy his room because Amsterdam (with sun) is an urban paradise. Daniel is a privileged man..."
