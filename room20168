"1",20168,28186,"2010-03-02",70091,"Justin","The location of Sasha's B&B makes it ideal for short Amsterdam visits; everything you might want to see is walkable. 

We stayed in the smallest room of the building, which was o.k. for the one night we spent. Our room was neat and clean, as was the bathroom. If you travel with more luggage and want to stay longer, make sure to book a bigger room. Unfortunately, on the site it's not quite clear how to choose the room you'll be staying in.

"2",20168,59572,"2010-07-01",114288,"Jennifer","The room was much smaller than in the picture, was filled with Mosquitos and was very hot. However, the host was friendly and let us check in an hour early, as well as let us use another rooms shower when our room wasn't ready yet."
"3",20168,3568844,"2013-02-18",4701293,"Enrique","The place was much better than I thought. Very nice room and the host was very friendly. Actually I didn't make too much use of the room, just came back to collect my luggage. I guess that's Amsterdam, :-)."
"4",20168,9889567,"2014-01-17",10560656,"Francesca","La camera non era quella delle foto, ma nel complesso era molto carina ed accogliente con vista sulla strada principale.
Purtroppo il nostro problema più grande è che abbiamo avuto la visita di un piccolo topo di città sotto il letto una delle sere in camera. La pulizia era buona, e il propietario è stato premuroso e disponibile in piena notte per aiutarci a risolvere il problema. In ogni caso credo che sia giusto comunicarlo qui, se pur spero che l'episodio non si ripresenti più...
Il bagno e molto piccolo e non ha riscaldamento, in più la piccola finestra è sempre aperta quindi fare la doccia ci è rimasto un pò complicato perchè faceva davvero molto freddo.
La posizione è senz'altro ottima poichè permette di raggiungere ogni attrazione a piedi senza utilizzare i costosissimi trasporti pubblici. Coffee shop, ristoranti italiani e argentini, souvenir, cinema e casinò nelle vicinanze."

"8",20168,21003565,"2014-10-09",14877752,"Eliza","My stay at Alex's apartment was everything I needed it to be! The room was in a great location, close enough to walk to all the main attractions. The room was fairly small however the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The only thing bad about the room was that it was situated on a main road and the traffic noise was very loud throughout the night. Other than that, had a pleasant stay. Thanks Alex! "
"9",20168,22435251,"2014-11-06",22375949,"Eugenia","Il soggiorno trascorso in questa stanza è stato delizioso, l'ambiente é piccolo ma ci si muove bene, il bagno è condiviso ma nella privacy e discrezione totale. Il proprietario ci ha dotato di tutto ciò di cui avevamo bisogno, asciugamani e lenzuola pulite, saponi, phon e tv in camera e sopratutto il wi-fi. È in pieno centro, a un passo da tutte le cose più importanti da vedere in città e per gli spostamenti ha la fermata del tram sotto casa. È il posto ideale per vivere un week-end romantico o con  amici ad Amsterdam! Lo consiglio a tutti per l' ottimo rapporto qualità-prezzo!!"
"10",20168,23214498,"2014-11-25",2683224,"Andreia","The room is really cosy and just in the middle of everything. Loved the location. Good shower and comfortable bed. Alex told us everything we needed to know when we arrived. Thank you for an excellent stay, Alex. We loved Amsterdam!"
"11",20168,24494592,"2014-12-29",24684928,"Louise","Really good room, just on the top of a small breakfast restaurant ! Perfectly located, just next to the Foam - we went there at the opening - and the flower market... Alex left guides for us and really welcoming. Thank you !"

"13",20168,25266085,"2015-01-11",13073874,"Coline","The room is nice and in a very centric neighborhood. The bathroom is small but clean and functional. However this is not an ""airbnb"" sharing experience, we only saw Alex for 5 minutes when checked in so it's more of a hotel than a local house. Anyway we had a nice time there and can not complain aboout the service. Thanks Alex."
"14",20168,25382686,"2015-01-14",22619846,"Rebeca","Alugar um quarto com o Alex foi uma ótima experiência. 
O local é muito perto do centro de Amsterdam e de todas as outras coisas necessárias. 
Alex nos recebeu no horário combinado, nos mostrou o quarto, explicou tudo o que era necessário e nos deu um mapa da cidade.
Se voltar em Amsterdam, com certeza ficarei novamente em um dos quartos do Alex. "
"15",20168,25593387,"2015-01-20",23588641,"Martin","Awesome location in Amsterdam's city centre. Walking distance from every location, we did not use the tram in our whole stay.

The room is very comfortable and though it is in the city centre, at night you hear almost nothing from the outside."
"16",20168,26335529,"2015-02-09",19308683,"Joshua","The place is at a good location, near to the center.  The room was nice and quiet.  It has sturdy, hardwood floors, two locks for entry.  One lock is the main entrance, the other is for the room.  You get a key for both locks.

Two power strips for charging and other electrical needs.  Hangers and shelves to keep your clothes nice.  Flat screen monitor with remote control for entertainment.

The bed was very comfortable and kept me very warm through the cold night.

I would definitely stay here again.
"
"17",20168,26632591,"2015-02-16",16469411,"Pascal","Alex is a kind man who described us everything and gave us some tips.The room is in a great spot of Amsterdam with many bars and restaurants around. We assumed a nice, comfortable and clean room and our expectations have been fulfilled! The only negative point: The café at the ground floor started playing music at 6.30 in the morning. "
"18",20168,26794841,"2015-02-19",710151,"Kelly","I'd recommend this place! Great location, great price. The room was clean and in a central location. Also very close to the tram that takes you to Central Station. 

There are small/steep stairs up to the room. This was not a problem for us, but good to know for other travelers! 

The bathroom is connected to the room, but is not heated. Once you turn the hot water on, you are fine (but something to keep in mind for traveling during the winter). "
"19",20168,27398306,"2015-03-03",14208608,"Flore","The place was very close to the center, accessible by foot, we really enjoyed this proximity! It was clean and the bed was good. The bathroom was a little cold but during winter it's not that surprising. The breakfast place in the same building was perfect. It's pretty much like a hotel room. "
"20",20168,27802184,"2015-03-12",27577493,"Anthony","Unfortunately I was not met at the place when I arrived and started to get a bit worried. The receptionist in the hotel next door fortunately found his phone number and he explained that he had to go to hospital at short notice and a friend would let me in soon which he did.

But a comfy night after I asked for the heating to be put on,which seemed to be missing the second night.(Which came on early next morning)"

Zuvor der Mailkontakt etwas anstrengend, um die genaue Adresse zu bekommen. Stellte aber als unbegründet heraus."

great location "

"26",20168,29609526,"2015-04-10",12394887,"Eva & Ralf","We stayed here for two nights, everything is clean and tidy. Alex is a nice guy, we found a city map and the explanations were ok. I'd recommend this place"

"28",20168,30387835,"2015-04-21",16740497,"Daniela","Bella camera con bagno privato al secondo piano di questo palazzo classico di Amsterdam, vicinissima al mercato dei fiori. Alex è stato un pochino insistente per sapere l'ora esatta del check-in, e purtroppo noi abbiamo ritardato di un paio d'ora sulle nostre tabelle di marcia, avvisandolo ma sentendoci quasi sgridati. Consigliato, ma occhio ad avvisarlo sull'ora d'arrivo!"
"29",20168,31770637,"2015-05-10",6348846,"Kathrin","Alex met us at the expected time in the Apartment and gave us good directions and also Nice recommendations for Dinner. The  Studio is centrally located, Attraktions in walking distance, very clean and quiet although the Tram stops in front of the House. The bathroom is a bit small, but okay. We enjoyed our stay and will come back."

"31",20168,32117388,"2015-05-14",30292985,"Hanne","Alex was very friendly. The room was super clean and decent. Great location, everything is nearby and you don't need public transport."
"32",20168,33512780,"2015-05-29",31347731,"Brunella","La camera rispecchia esattamente quanto descritto. Il bagno è un po' piccolo, ma in ogni caso funzionale. La camera era pulita, e la posizione dello stabile a due passi dal centro, comodissima sia di giorno che di notte e adiacente ad un ottimo bar dove fare colazione con un buon caffè espresso.
Alex è stato molto gentile e disponibile.
Consigliato per visite brevi, in quanto tutti gli extra (lenzuola ed asciugamani puliti) hanno costi aggiuntivi per permanenze inferiori ai 7 giorni."
"33",20168,33968757,"2015-06-02",15711677,"Jamie","The room is very clean, bed is super comfortable and the duvet is very soft. Alex met me on time, helped me get acquainted with the space and then gave me a lot of privacy. The flat is in a great locations, close to many nice restaurants and for walking around the centre. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam."
"34",20168,34522901,"2015-06-09",379669,"Eddie","Great price and location.  Good bed, no street noise, good water pressure and hot water, shower is small.  Surprised how quiet the neighborhood was at night, but it was Monday.  STEEP stairs, narrow steps.  Best for the young and agile."
"35",20168,35214855,"2015-06-16",31344367,"Mariana","Our stay in Amsterdam couldn't be better than this one. The room is very confortable and close to everything touristic. Just pretty good and amazing."
"36",20168,35554468,"2015-06-20",5363621,"Valerie","The place is well located and the room is clean.the wifii didnt work properly on our iphones but thats pretty much the only thing we have to say.I would recommand this place."
"37",20168,35798262,"2015-06-22",31710574,"Riona","We had a very warm welcome with detailed directions from Alex, and he availed himself to answer all our questions. The room was lovely and had everything we needed and the best part was the location, the tram stop is right outside! I would recommend this to fellow travellers. Thank you Alex for a lovely stay in Amsterdam, we really had an unforgettable time."
"38",20168,36022306,"2015-06-24",9814509,"Haley","Our stay was great! The room is beautiful and is in a great location. Alex was there to meet us with the keys and answer any questions we had. If I find myself back in Amsterdam, I would definitely stay again. The wifi didn't work very well but other than that, not a complaint to be had!"
"39",20168,36269703,"2015-06-27",28586568,"Danielle","Great location, clean room, comfy bed. Thank you Alex!"
"40",20168,36668541,"2015-06-30",29963216,"Chelsea","My boyfriend and I stayed at Alex's apartment for 2 nights. We were due to arrive at 1.30pm, however missed our flight so didn't arrive until 3.15pm. When I messaged Alex that morning to explain that we would be a couple of hours late because of a missed flight, I got the reply 'well thanks for ruining my plans!!!!!' While I could understand us being late would be annoying for him, this was not a very nice response. 
However, once we did get there, we really enjoyed our stay at the apartment!
The bedroom was big, the bed was super comfortable, and the place was very clean. It was in a great location-central, with a tram station right outside if needed. Alex included a map and some touristy information when checking in. The wifi didn't work very well, but the rest of the apartment made up for it. We would recommend this airbnb. 

"
"41",20168,37141915,"2015-07-05",29872225,"Darryll","Alex was an excellent host. He greeted us and gave us a quick overview of rules and things we needed to know about our location.  Alex was excellent with communication and always responded my texts promptly. The house is centrally located and very convenient. He was wonderful as my first Airbnb experience and I would absolutely stay with him again.  "
"42",20168,37464943,"2015-07-07",32834438,"Morgan","The room is at a great location and very easy to get to from Central Station. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend. "
"43",20168,37649849,"2015-07-09",19533921,"Sean","Alex's house is extremely central and the bed is the highlight of the rooms, extremely comfortable. Alex accommodated our request for evening check-in and provided maps and tourist information for the city. However, the Wi-Fi signal is weak and could be strengthened and the stairwell to the rooms is steep, narrow and has low headroom.  Knowing this, I would stay here again and recommend it to friends."
"44",20168,38258194,"2015-07-14",29888294,"Brittany","Beautiful flat in Amsterdam! It was the perfect location. Alex was there to greet us and was very helpful. The internet was slow, but overall I would definitely recommend this flat. "
"45",20168,38833169,"2015-07-19",22777843,"Saraf","Alex was a lovely host. The location is excellent, walking distance to many attractions. We really enjoyed our stay."
"46",20168,39291352,"2015-07-22",10081816,"Manasi","Alex's place was in a great location, walking distance from everywhere. The apartment was very nicely furnished and quiet despite being on a main road. We enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to others! "
"47",20168,39612572,"2015-07-25",14250811,"Laura","Central location - walking distance to almost everything! 
There is a bar fridge however there isn't any kitchen facilities or bowls/cutlery etc so this is only really useful if you wanted to keep drinks cold etc unless you bring your own utensils. We ate breakfast down stairs at the local cafe as we were told we would get a special discount if we mentioned we were staying with Alex - for two breakfasts we only got a 1 euro discount that, for a 28 euro bill, wasn't that much in the scheme of things. I would recommend exploring elsewhere as we found you could get much cheaper breakfasts at other cafes around Amsterdam. However, this cafe wasn't bad and the coffee was yum. The room was clean and tidy and the bed was very comfortable. Alex gave us a quick run down of everything on the first day and then was never to be seen again which, to be honest, was nice as it felt like we weren't sharing with anyone! It's like a studio apartment minus the kitchen and laundry! Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, thank you Alex."
"48",20168,39926678,"2015-07-27",33119605,"Bijal","The room was pleasant and clean. Bed was comfortable. Location was very good and central to site seeing in Amsterdam. However it was on a main road so we could hear the road with the window open. 
Shower was good temperature and easy to use, however just be aware the bathroom itself is very very small (a larger sized person might struggle)
Meant to meet Alex at 12, we arrived few minutes early,  rang the doorbell and continued to ring it intermittently over the next 30 minutes.  He did not respond and we had to ask the hotel next door to use the wifi so we could contact him. We were waiting outside in the rain and when he opened the door, he didn't seem very apologetic and made a comment that because we arrived early he wasn't to hear the doorbell.He didn't offer to help with our bags,  and again for anyone considering this air bnb should be aware the stairs are spiralling, narrow and steep. Once in the room, he went through information with us and was very quick to get the city tax from us and ask when we would check out. He did ask us if we had any more questions and gave us the opportunity to ask however because of how.our interaction begun,  we felt we couldn't really ask. Overall I would not rate this place for hosting skills to enhance your experience when visiting Amsterdam as we found it very transactional and impersonal and as if we were a burden however the room itself is perfectly pleasant and good if your just looking for a place to stay."
"49",20168,41066184,"2015-08-04",6565851,"Marcus","We had a marvelous stay in Amsterdam and a nice room. The location is perfect and it's easy to reach all important and less important sightseeing places. However please keep in mind the room is located next to a big street with its typical traffic and noise. Nevertheless we enjoyed our stay! Thank you!"
"50",20168,41364608,"2015-08-07",34608309,"Natalie","The location of this apartment is perfect. Walkable distance to everything and we loved the bakery below. Alex was extremely nice and helpful. The place was very modern and clean. We highly recommend to anyone staying in Amsterdam."

Chambre tres bien située , propre et bien équipée . Lit tres confortable 
Hôte ponctuel et pas dérangeant 
A recommander "
"52",20168,42707978,"2015-08-15",33905504,"Nigel","A  cheerful welcome from Alex, information about getting around the city and quick tour of the dos and don'ts. The room and ensuite are great and the traffic noise no problem.
Don't be put off by an apartment close to the centre; Amsterdam is a wonderfully compact, clean and friendly city with millions of clean, quiet bicycles. Pretty much everyone speaks English (and they aren't offended if you don't speak Dutch) and are incredibly helpful.
You can hire a bike, but the combination of :  millions of others, other side of the road, an unfamiliar bike and maybe a beer or two is not likely to be relaxing. The city is small enough to explore on foot or buy a day ticket for the brilliant public transport system.
Have fun, Nigel"
"53",20168,43360267,"2015-08-19",22372373,"David","This place was fantastic. Walking distance from everything you'd want to visit in Amsterdam! Alex was very efficient and helpful. Would stay here again ! "
"54",20168,44316495,"2015-08-25",37838735,"Natalie","The room is exactly as pictured, a small but bright and comfortable room.  Do note that the bathroom is quite small but manageable.  Alex's friend met us to check in and was at least 30 minutes late.  That being said, Alex was easily reachable by phone and resolved the situation.  The bed was very comfortable and we had a great stay in this place.  Would stay again and would highly recommend!"
"55",20168,45102126,"2015-08-31",10068148,"Andy","The host turned up on time to hand over the keys and explain a few things. The location is very central. The noise is not too bad considering it is on one of the main streets with trams. Towels, shampoo and soap were provided."
"56",20168,45953666,"2015-09-07",4126783,"Leandra","The studio is exactly as described. Alex was there to give us the keys and explain everything. The bathroom is very small but it's alright for a short stay. My friend and I really enjoyed staying there and I would recommend this place to everyone who plans a short stay in Amsterdam and wants to live central."
"57",20168,48163897,"2015-09-24",32938213,"Nathan","We really enjoyed our stay here. Everything was as promised. It is close to all the main attractions and we found we walked everywhere during our three night stay. It is approx 5-10mins walk to Dam Square. The room is roomy, well furnished, and had good security having to enter through two lockable doors. The bed is very comfortable, not to soft but not rock hard either. It has a cosy shower and toilet that is your own. There was little to no noise during the day or night. Alex was friendly and provided us with the information we needed. Next time we visit Amsterdam we will definitely be staying here. Great work Alex. Stayed as a couple from Sydney Australia."
"58",20168,49598551,"2015-10-05",35534159,"Carly","Lovely room, great location. The bed was really comfortable and room very spacious. Shower was  nice and hot. Five minutes walk to shops and restaurants. Only thing would say negatively is that the room lighting is very dim so we found it difficult to get ready in the evening, and the Internet signal was not great."
"59",20168,49907901,"2015-10-07",43357448,"Tegpal","Alex is very nice, helpful, and informative. The room was nice and cozy. It was very quiet and peaceful. There is a coffee shop below, which is very convenient. Everything is walking distance and the tram stops right in front of the house. The only thing was we heavily relayed on WiFi, but the signal was very low and you would only get WiFi in certain areas of the room."
"60",20168,50165898,"2015-10-10",32962059,"Sarah","Really loved Amsterdam and the apartment made it all the more enjoyable for us. It's very centrally located, so we didn't use transport once other than to and from the station. It was clean, and spacious. The bathroom is slightly small, but we knew that up front and it didn't make the stay unbearable at all. Alex accommodated us with an early check in for no additional costs and was easily accessible throughout our stay. He was very welcoming and forthcoming with information about Amsterdam to make our stay better! Thanks for an amazing experience Alex."
"61",20168,50627859,"2015-10-13",40345406,"April","Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for 3 nights and it was ideal. The location meant we could walk everywhere around the city although the metro did stop right outside. Lovely, clean apartment. Would definitely recommend staying here. "
"62",20168,50777582,"2015-10-14",44488161,"Dorian","I enjoyed the stay at Alex's place. The room was clean, smart and well presented. Handy for central Amsterdam, and handy for breakfast.. Alex was very accommodating even when I ended up running late to meet him. Will most likely use the room again."

Alex was very helpful in accommodating my daughter and her boyfriend on their first trip away on their own and the security of the property helped to make them feel safe and very comfortable 
Highly recommended "
"65",20168,52321993,"2015-10-28",22473069,"Lisa","The listing was as described; simple and clean, w Windows that were able to block out the noise from below. We were located close to many of the more important sites Amsterdam, but i think staying in a quieter and less touristy spot may have be preferable.  

Alex was rather unpleasant to work with. He wanted to know the ""exact"" time we would be arriving in Amsterdam, which can be somewhat difficult when traveling.  He seemed agitated and rushed, and his entire demeanor left us w an unpleasant feel for our surroundings. "
"66",20168,52421511,"2015-10-29",44686127,"Laura","Alex was a gracious host and the room is just as the picture. The location is fantastic, close to everything and the city is very easy to navigate. Alex was also very helpful with suggestions! "
"67",20168,52987115,"2015-11-03",32949479,"Tom","The apartment is in a great location and is perfect for a city break on a budget. Alex was very friendly and welcoming despite the fact we were late for check-in (air bnb's map led us slightly astray for finding the door - it's further from the corner than the map suggests but is clearly  numbered, we were just being a bit absent minded)."
"68",20168,53463432,"2015-11-09",43153224,"Nicole","Alex was extremely welcoming, waiting up for us due to our late arriving flight. When we did finally arrive, he showed us our room, explained how everything worked and gave us a map of Amsterdam, telling us where the best places to go were. He was very helpful!"
"69",20168,53961073,"2015-11-15",36887696,"Charlie","My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay at Alex's. Even though we arrived early, Alex was very welcoming and was happy to show us around our room. We were given a map and showed the best places  to visit/eat and Alex even gave us an adapter because we forgot to bring our own. This apartment is very conveniently located, we walked everywhere and only got a tram once from the station when we first arrived. The bed was extremely comfy and the shower was really good too. Alex even put up a little Christmas tree which made the room look even nicer. We would definitely stay here again if we returned to Amsterdam! :)"

I was arriving early and Alex was nice enough to let me check in earlier. The private bathroom is a plus, it's a small one but there's nothing too inconvenient, especially for a short stay. There's a small fridge in the room as well, and everything was clean and neat. The apartment is on one of the main streets but the room was impressingly quiet at night. "

Very central as well - everything seemed a walk away and we saw a lot of Amsterdam by foot. Bedding super comfortable ! Alex was very friendly and ready to help ! The little café downstairs is a nice plus. Thank you for the wonderful long weekend."

Our train arrived late which I feel terrible about holding Alex up but he was lovely and very understanding he gave us a run down of how things worked and left us be. The room was huge and bed was amazingly comfortable. Would stay again in a heart beat and highly recommend."

Only little issue was the 5% city tax at the start which we weren't aware of as its not on the listing but it was a small fee and we let Alex know to clarify for next time. Other than that it was a nice little convenient space. "

The location of the place is great, short walking distance to Amsterdam's flower market and on the major trams way. Alex was very professional, explanatory from the beginning I contacted him and during my stay. The room was exactly how it was described in the pictures and extremely clean.

Also, the communication was not very pleasant. I've been living in 10+ airbnb and this host is by far the worst one. He seems to be impatient about answering my questions and explaining things in detail."
"82",20168,60004137,"2016-01-18",4624591,"Anton","We stayed one night on a layover.

Alex was friendly and easy to get in touch with. He waited for us at the apartment, talked us through various things such as using the shower, the keys, and other things, and left us to explore the city. As we were in Amsterdam for only one night, we didn't need to get in touch with him a lot, but for those few times that we had to talk to him, he promptly responded by text.

In general, the room was comfortable. The bed was great, and, although we didn't need to use it, it was good to know that we had access to a mini-fridge. 

Our only concern was the bathroom. The toilet seat was located so high that it wasn't very comfortable to use. My girlfriend's feet, for instance, could not reach the floor when she was sitting down. We didn't mind this problem too much because we stayed at the room for such a short amount of time, but someone who stays there longer might find the toilet to cause them more discomfort.

So, while I would recommend this place for a short visit to Amsterdam, I don't know if one would find it comfortable to deal with the bathroom on a longer trip."

Alex gave us a quick tour, a map and showed us the main areas to visit. There's also a little café underneath the room where you can have breakfast. We had a nice time!  "
"87",20168,61439175,"2016-02-04",28154632,"Debora","The room was very nice and clean (exactly as it looks on all the pictures). Centrally located, which was a huge plus! Small downsides of the room were the not so very strong wifi connection, not being able to store or luggage after check-out, and the cold bathroom. Alex also wasn't there when we checked out, and he never answerred on the text message we sent when we left. Therefore we had to assume everything was okay. Even though there was no possibility of storing our luggage for the rest of the day after we checked out, Alex suggested we asked to store it at the cafe on the ground floor right under the room. It was a really cosy cafe where we had a coffee, smoothie and breakfast and the lady was kind enough to store our bags until closing time. If I go back to Amsterdam, I would definitely consider going back to this Airbnb! "

"89",20168,62073062,"2016-02-11",39628821,"Samm","A cosy apartment in close distance to everything the centre of Amsterdam has to offer: a stones throw away from the Flower Market and Museum quarter. 

The bed is super comfortable, and the room is decorated to a high standard. The fridge is a welcome addition, perfect for storing drinks and a few goodies. 

Alex was a great host, and very accommodating. He provided us with a map and orientated us as well as giving us tips on where to go. Although we didn't need him, it's great to know he's available to answer queries 24/7. Thank you Alex! 

In Amsterdam, it's worth visiting the Artis Zoo. We also discovered the Dutch Resistance Museum close by the Zoo, which provides a poignant insight into Amsterdam in World War 2- a must to visit.  

The only downside was the small bathroom: the toilet is a little high for those challenged with height, and the shower a little small. This didn't impact our time at all, and being on a short break meant the bathroom was not of massive concern. 

Finally, have euros prepared for the tourist tax to pay upon arrival. 

In all, a wonderful apartment to have spent our time in Amsterdam. "

I thought this was a bit sketchy as really AirBNB hosts should never ask for extra cash without having disclosed that up front. When I explained I already paid it he didn't press it but I still thought it was unprofessional. However the room is as it looks and as the description says, it's very comfortable and great location.

Die Kommunikation  vorher  und während unseres Aufenthalts war sehr gut, freundlich und unkompliziert.
Das Zimmer war sauber und und mit allem ausgestattet was man für einen Kurztrip braucht. Das Badezimmer ist sehr klein aber auch vollkommen ausreichend.
Die Lage ist perfekt um die Stadt zu Fuß oder mit dem Fahrrad zu erkunden. Wir werden bei unserem nächsten Aufenthalt  in Amsterdam wieder bei Alex übernachten.
Wir waren sehr zufrieden. "
"94",20168,65152845,"2016-03-11",5281612,"Taylor","Alex was a great host. He worked with us because we had an usually early arrival into Amsterdam and was welcoming from the moment we arrived at his house. 

The room is very close to everything in the city center. It is about a 5-15 minute walk or tram ride to nearly every place of interest in the city. And if you choose to take the tram, there is a stop directly in front of Alex's entrance. 

Alex provided us with a map of Amsterdam and gave us some advice, but left us alone to explore thereafter. He was always available if we needed to contact him though. 

The bathroom was quite small, though this seems to be common in Holland and the street grew louder at night the closer it got to the weekend. But overall no complaints. Would definitely stay here again. "

The bed and linens are nicer than in my own home, so that was a treat!  The bedroom is spacious and the bathroom is tiny but has everything you need, including plenty of hot water. 
The location is ideal: easy walking distance to the major museums and historic Amsterdam.  We had a wonderful time and would happily stay here again on future trips to Amsterdam."

We didn't meet Alex but his friend Jan came to greet us, very helpful and kind person . He gave us some special tips and places to visit and kept contact till the end. 

The only things I would add to this place considering that it's not a cheap place are an electric kettle and some cups and glasses. The shower curtain should be changed into a glass one as it's very annoying having it sticked  with you while you're showering in a small shower . I don't find it fair to have to pay for the towels and linen if you need them to be changed before 4 days or so (I don't exactly remember the days ) . 

Please note that I would still book this place if I make it back to amsterdam . :)"

The room was very clean and spacious, bed was comfortable, location was central (tram stop was literally a couple steps outside the door but with the beautiful weather that day we just walked around Amsterdam instead) and Alex was friendly and super prompt to reply us whenever we needed anything! Also loved the fact that there was a lovely quaint little cafe just downstairs which served good coffee and cakes.

Only down side was that as with any typically older buildings in Amsterdam, the sound proofing wasn't great.  So you could hear your neighbours walking above you in the middle of the night.  And it would've been nice if there was a kettle in the room.  But all things that were bearable during our stay. 

Would still definitely recommend staying here anytime.  "

Flat was as described. Location was great with tram stop right outside. Our flight was delayed by an hour so we exchanged texts with Alex (who lives above) and his hand over was therefore a bit rushed but it was clear. Tight spiral staircase to flat but rail to hold onto. Bed large and comfortable. Bathroom very small but adequate. Would have loved a kettle and mugs so we could make a hot drink and glasses that fit under the tap to drink water.  Fridge was a bonus. Cafe for coffee/breakfast is next door and plenty of eating places nearby.  Make sure you get the hang of the window opening as it's a bit stiff."

The room itself is located on the second floor. Double bed - very large and very comfortable. The bathroom is very small but clean and well maintained with a small window. There is also a small fridge available and some glasses.
A Café is located directly downstairs in the building with good breakfast offers.
Only Con was that only one window in the room can be opened (and that only tilted). WiFi has adequate speed (you can choose from 3 Accesspoints).
Our host Alex was nice and friendly and gave us a quick introduction to the appartment and Amsterdam in general. Overall it was a great stay and a top location to discover the city."

The Place is close to the center and the tram/bus stop so the place is great if you are looking for a central space to sleep. It doesn't have the personal touch and flair of a private apartment, more of a hostel room. I guess it was built just for airbnb purposes. We can recommend it anyways to all sorts of travellers!"

The bathroom is a bit smaller but manageable for a few days stay. The shower varied in temperature and pressure, but also okay. Conor, who was there at our arrival was very pleasant and helpful, which was a great surprise because from my previous communications Alex (the host), was impatient in settling the check in time and when I kindly asked if it was possible to change it, he said ""too many changes, fine now but will not change anymore"". I thought that was rude since I had not asked to change it before. But anyway, we ended up not meeting him and that's why I said meeting Conor was a nice surprise. The location is great. I recommend it!"

The bathroom was a little small and there was a problem with one of the windows. We also found that there wasn't much lighting in the room. This aside, the room and bathroom were very clean with all the essentials provided, and the bed was comfortable.

Alex was away during our stay so we checked-in with Conor who was very friendly and more than willing to help and answer any questions we had. 

We would certainly stay here again on our next trip to Amsterdam.

I never had any issues during my one week of stay. The studio is situated in a very convenient location and right next to it is a very vibrant area with bars, restaurants and such. Other places are also very accessible. I would recommend staying there. Would recommend staying there."

"119",20168,109701581,"2016-10-23",63977631,"Avril","I felt like we were lucky to stay in such a central location! We walked out the door, turned right, and just a block away were plenty of restaurants, bars, and shopping. The apartment is practically around the corner from Rembrandt Square! 
The only thing that put a damper on the trip was when I communicated that our train had been delayed and would get in at 7:30 instead of 4:30, still within the original 2-10pm check-in guidelines. Alex's immediate response was that we were pretty much SOL because he would not be home and there was no way for us to get the keys to our room. Eventually he was able to get a friend to wait for our arrival in order to let us in, show us our room and explain all the rules. However, he charged us extra money for the inconvenience.  It took a lot of back-and-forth texting to get to that point. I was stressing out.  I think that it would be nice if he had a contingency plan in case of delays that are out of the guests' control.
Once we got settled everything was fine. The room is more spacious than I expected, the bed is comfortable, and we were glad to have a TV. The bathroom is a little small but has good water pressure.  It was like a hotel room with no access to other areas of the house, and that was fine with us. I would recommend staying there and being careful to make sure your arrival time is accurate. You might want to give yourself a little cushion to account for arriving, not just the time your flight or train gets in, because he won't wait around for long and might try to charge you for making a change.  But again, the location is just perfect for walking out the front door and getting to explore the center of the city by walking or biking.  Have fun!"

"132",20168,120871044,"2016-12-12",1305659,"Anna","Alex made us feel very welcome and answered all our questions and offered to help with anything if we needed assistance.
The location was perfect for discovering Amsterdam on foot. We were close to all kinds of shops and museums etc. The tram stop was immediately outside the door and came by very frequently. We didn't need to use it except on our arrival and departure. About 10 minutes or less from Central Station.
This is a very old house , as described by Alex, so don't let the steep stairs and worn walls of the entrance hall put you off: the room is as shown in the pictures and is quite roomy and comfortable. Lots of heat and hot water provided. The wi-fi was excellent. Though on a busy street it was surprisingly quiet at night and in the mornings. We had a very comfortable sleep in a very comfy bed! We found the fridge a very good asset to us.I could find no fault with the apartment except I would like at least one bright light for reading our travel guide.
As others have said in reviews the high toilet is a little inconvenient but you get used to it. And when you love the convenience of the location and all the other assets outlined above, it doesn't really matter!
Before we travelled to Amsterdam I asked Alex would he consider supplying a kettle and two cups but he graciously declined!It would have been so convenient! But there are numerous cafes round about.
Alex didn't bother us during our stay and was easy when it came to our departure. I would recommend this apartment for a short stay in fabulous Amsterdam and it would be our dream to return and hopefully Alex will host us again!

A 15 to 20min walk from Amsterdam Central station or just 10min by tram that literally stops in front of the airbnb. 5min from Rembrandt square where there are a dozen of restaurants. Extremely comfortable if you want to spend time in the city center. The house is old and the room is on the 2nd floor. You have to go up a narrow stairs, so it is preferable to come here if you travel light. Bed is great and the area is relatively quiet. The bathroom is cold during the winter and kinda small, but nothing to complain about. The host Alex was friendly and to the point. Discuss with him  regarding the key for when you have to check out."

We arrived earlier than expected and were greeted by Alex who was very friendly and welcoming. He left us the keys, recommended a place to start our evening and was on his way 5 minutes later to leave us to get on with our trip. The room was clean, warm and the bed very comfortable. Shower had very good water pressure and easy to use. Location was perfect and we were able to walk easily to everywhere we wanted to go. Me and my girlfriend agreed we would definitely stay there again if we ever go back to Amsterdam. Highly recommend to couples looking to stay in the city."

The room is spacious and cozy. The place is about 4 tram stops from Centraal station. You can take Tram no.16 which stops right in front of the place. Very easy to find the place. Walking distance to the flower market, dam square and Royal Palace. Enjoyed our stay and hopefully can stay there again in the future."
"150",20168,132175237,"2017-02-16",39941388,"Mariah","This private room was as expected. You have to go up a bit of steps to get to the studio, which wasn't a big deal at all, but just a warning if you have a hard time going up stairs or have super heavy luggage. The location is good, pretty close to museums, and to central Amsterdam. I've never experienced an Airbnb that charges for early/late checkout after set times, and that also will charge for baggage hold even after all Airbnb fees are paid. Wasn't too stoked on that as most Airbnb hosts will let you check in early for free and will hold your bags for free as well if possible, but this is noted in the description. So nothing to really complain about. Good location, clean room and clean and private bathroom- but small. We had a nice stay and host was very nice. "

We had a great flat that overlooks the Main Street giving us a great view of the busy city below.  Our private bathroom was clean and efficient. The mini refrigerator was nice and gave us a spot to keep some snacks cold. We felt completely safe and secure our entire stay.  The central location gave us quick access to all of the sights and public transportation that takes you anywhere you want to go quickly.  We found great pubs and restaurants and even a fresh food market within walking distance of our home away from home.  Rembrandt square is just around the corner. Our host was great and did a great job communicating with us before our stay and was completely accessible to us if we needed him during our visit.  This is a nice home base to visit Amsterdam! "

You can reach the City Centre and everything else within some minutes of walking. However, the price per night seems a little unjustified regarding the size of the apartment. In addition to that, the walls are wafer-thin, hence it is an old house. The house is situated next to a main street which might be very noisy, too. But this depends on the daytime. Nonetheless, the accommodation  is ideal for spending just a couple of nights. Alex, the host, has been very friendly, helpful and answered all our questions. We would recommend this apartment, if you are planning to stay in Amsterdam just for several days."

It's good to live in central place, which means you can walk to any tourist attractions conveniently. Actually, Alex place just locates in the central line of Amsterdam, between the central station and Amsterdam national museum.

The only suggestion I have is to furnish the room with a full length mirror l or place the wall mirror lower. Some of us travelers are shorter than the native Dutch ;)"

Please remember to bring your own towels and loo paper if you're staying for a while, these weren't replaced or replenished. Apart from that, everything was as expected. The location is great so it can be a bit busy at night. The downside to this was there was a man who claimed he knew Alexander and tried to enter our Room every night. Clearly intoxicated but luckily my boyfriend knows jujitsu and was able to fight him off night after night.

"181",20168,210428021,"2017-11-09",153769759,"Jean","Alex's place is in a great location, close to many sights such as Rembrandt Square. There is also a tram stop really close by. Very convenient for exploring other areas of the city.  The building itself is quite old. You'll need to climb two flights of stairs to get to the room, which is a little dark. I would suggest putting brighter lights, as it makes for easier packing and unpacking. The wifi signal was weak and spotty at times, so it's not great if you are heavily reliant on wifi. The building is made of wood and quite old, so sometimes you can hear feel vibrations when neighbours slam their doors (so make sure you don't slam yours). Unfortunately, that's just part of staying in an old wooden apartment. The bathroom is a bit tight, and you will be instructed to leave the little window open, as there are no ventilators installed. As there's no heater in the bathroom, the bathroom will be very cold, if the weather is cold. Get ready to sit on a cold toilet seat, which also happens to be unusually high. Fortunately the shower doors help to keep the heat in while showering. If you stay here, watch out for the knobs that stick out of the bed rails. We jammed our hips into it several times, as the space between the bed and the wall and windows is quite narrow, and the room is dark. Also, there is no hot water boiler/electric kettle in the room (due to an incident with a previous guest, we were told), so you won't be able to make coffee or tea. Fortunately there are some really nice cafes and bakeries (go to 
 C'est Magnifique at Leidsestraat 18) below and nearby. If not for the above-mentioned points, I would rate this room 5 stars, as the location is really good."

Si buscas una cama cómoda y además que el apartamento este bien ubicado, sin duda te recomiendo hospedarte aquí.

"183",20168,216514590,"2017-12-04",57723283,"John","About a week before we were due to arrive in Amsterdam we received three or four messages from the host concerning our check-in time. We had received others before this, however they appeared as automatic messages, and did not respond(This was our mistake, of course). A few on this occasion appeared to be automatic messages, however there were a few more after which were quite panicked and regarded our expected check-in time. Alex said that he had planned a trip to Germany and that he wouldn't be able to check us in and that we would have to pay a 25€ service charge for somebody else to wait and check us in. It was still a week before we were due to arrive, and we did not feel we needed to provide a check-in time this soon. While it is not Alex's fault that we did not respond to his messages initially, we found his responses quite blunt, and had a lot of emphasis on how the situation ""was not his fault"". At no point did we blame him for the situation, and we paid the charge for our check-in, which was within the times provided on his page, as he had to get somebody to wait for us.

The accomodation and ammenities were all up to standard, and it appears from his reviews that Alex is a nice guy and a thoughtful host. Perhaps we caught him at a bad time, but we felt his communication with us was quite rude and unnecessarily panicked. 

Thank you for providing us with your home Alex."

In a role where customer service and cultural competency matter a great deal, my wife and I found Alex to be demanding (he changed our check-in time without discussion or appreciation) and rude (I understand the Dutch can be direct in their communication, however the first thing Alex did was insult and offend us).

The building is very old and so our room was very hot for it being end of May/beginning of June. Our host offered us a 2nd fan which helped but the windows can’t be opened very much so it is very hard to get the room ventilated. Also, the WiFi was a bit unreliable. "

Only problem we had was the place was extremely warm as there is no aircon and only one window slightly opens. Also the wifi connection is very poor."

Así tal cuál con esas palabras, por eso me puse a ver sus evaluaciones y me di cuenta que ya había tratado a más personas así que , por lo tanto no llegamos. El trato debe ser cordial desde un principio y el no lo es así que no lo recomiendo en lo absoluto."

"226",20168,343643028,"2018-11-01",65610109,"Kirsty","We left booking our accommodation a bit late so weren't really sure what to expect when we arrived but we couldn't have been more pleased when we arrived! Perfect location within easy reach of all of the main tourist attractions. Lovely comfy bed and blackout curtains which helped block out some of the noise from the road (which wasn't particularly loud even when the curtains were open) Would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting Amsterdam."
"227",20168,344757041,"2018-11-04",37506766,"Lavinia","I had a very nice trip to Amsterdam. The room was clean and like in the pictures. Those big windows in the morning are an amazing boost for the day. The house is very well placed. You are basically near everything you have to visit in Amsterdam. We didn't used any tram, we walked and it was very cool. I recommend this place and if I will come back I guess I will come back to Alexander."

We can recommend the place very much if you want to stay for a short trip :)"

Es muy hermoso y la ubicación es buena, pero lo que realmente me hizo pasar mal y dudar en el momento de si perder mi dinero e irme a un hotel o quedarme allí fue el trato con Alex. Desde el momento 1 fue bastante rudo con los mensajes solo porque yo estaba trabajando y no los podía leer. Le expliqué y ya me había molestado bastante su forma de hablarme. 
Luego tuve otro problema cuando llegue a amsterdam, habíamos arreglado que me iría a buscar y me llevaría a la casa. Llegue y Alex esperaba que yo pudiera llegar sola a una terminal de salidas siendo que iba por primera vez a amsterdam, no tengo porque conocer el aeropuerto y además algo obvio. LLEGAMOS EN ARRIBOS Y SALIDAS ESTA AL OTRO LADO DEL AEROPUERTO. la comunicación fue malísima y el no nos habló nada bien. Es bastante grosero. Realmente me saco de quicio la situación y me tomé un uber porque era muy complicado. 
La casa es hermosa, pero no se si vale la pena, el trato es muy importante y es la primera impresión."
"232",20168,353272872,"2018-11-27",168761978,"Perry","Overall decent"
"233",20168,353942448,"2018-11-30",42302394,"Thalia","Alex's room is in a great location and is really good value for money (if you don't check in early/late)! 


The room had all the basics and was in such a fantastic location, especially given the reasonable price. The bed was comfortable and we had all the basics we needed. We only stayed for one night and it was perfect for us for one night. If you wanted to stay longer, it may be worth noting that the bathroom is pretty small and there are no tea making facilities/only plastic cups for drinking water from the bathroom tap. 

My main negative was that, as soon as we booked, we received an email with a list of extra costs for early/late check in (€25/35!), baggage storage etc. and it came across incredibly unfriendly and gave me the impression that the host was going to try to find any excuse to charge me extra. But everything was fine and we didn't pay anything extra. 

Overall, the room was perfect for us for a one night stay and really good value. Thanks!"
