The Houseboat is not 5 Star but it never proposed to be - what it is is a wonderfully comfortable place to stay in a brilliant location within walking distance to everywhere.
Simon is the perfect host - he showed us the boat gave us a few pointers to Amsterdam and then left us to ourselves.
We loved the experience and felt so much part of Amsterdam on the boat - I cannot recommend the experience highly enough.  We were able to cook a wonderful mean for ourselves on a number of nights and just sat looking out the Canal.
Certainly made Amsterdam, which is a wonderful city anyway, so much more special for us."

Also, in the bedroom there are 2 comfortable single beds, so it sleeps lots of people. We were only 3, so we were very comfortable. Simon lives in the same boat but you wouldn't notice. It's good to know he's right there if you need anything.

The location is great - city center, Amstel, but is really quiet as well. You can sleep with the windows open if you'd like without any issues. I guess being a city full of bikes instead of cars helps a lot.

I highly recommend Simon's place and I hope to stay there on my next visit to Amsterdam."

einziger Nachtteil ist, dass die angrenzende Strasse relativ laut ist
wir würden auf alle Fälle wiederbuchen
ach ja und aufpassen auf die Radfahrer beim rausgehen :-)"

Ansonsten ist aber die Lage sehr gut und das Mobiliar entsprechend der Bilder. Für einen kurzen Trip ist die Unterkunft sehr gut geeignet."
"5",760599,39100888,"2015-07-20",38213896,"Peter","TOP! We spent a weekend in Amsterdam with the whole family (4 persons). We arrived late, just before midnight. Checkin was perfectly organised and even Simon waited at the houseboat, welcoming us and giving us a short overview about all things we needed to know on the boat. Very friendly, giving hints about supermarkets, bike rentals, etc.... The boat is located right in the centre of Amsterdam, everything is pretty much walking distance and easy to reach. we really liked staying on the boat, no need for TV or internet (even everything is there for you)as the best thing to do (if you are at home) is watching the boats passing by on the Amstel. The accomodation is well equipped and has everything you need, we felt very comfortable. Even the town is very busy (day and night) we did not find it noisy and had an easy sleep. We can really recommend a stay at the Axo Houseboat for exploring this wonderful city. "

Propre et très fonctionnel, il ne nous a rien manqué.
Nous avons loué des vélos à 2 pas de là et les tram passent à 200m, idem pour le métro.

"7",760599,67484271,"2016-03-29",18629172,"Francesco","Very nice and cozy houseboat, 2 minutes walking far from Rembrandtplein and in a very quiet zone. Everything was absolutely perfect inside the house and we really appreciated all of the extra comfort, such as the bluetooth stereo and the guitar. Moreover, the swan that knocked several times to our window and came to visit us made our stay even more pleasant.
Eventually, Simon is very kind and available for any kind of request."

Værten Simon gav en venlig velkomst og fortalte om lejligheden i husbåden. Den indeholder, hvad der er behov for til en god ferie. Simon informerede også om en 5. maj koncert i nærheden, hvilket var en stor oplevelse at deltage i sammen med tusindvis andre.
Axo Houseboat er det perfekte sted at have som base for en storbyferie i Amsterdam"

"12",760599,90434482,"2016-08-01",2364239,"Peter","This is really cool place in the heart of downtown Amsterdam - for better or worse. Everything is within easy walking distance, but there tends to be a fair amount of late partying noise if your an early/light sleeper. 

The main space and bedroom are small but very comfortable. The kitchen is perfect for breakfasts and lunches, but would be a challenge for elaborate cooking. The bathroom is well, a little dingy but serviceable. 

Sitting on the sofa our kids shrieked when a swan swam to the window and pecked at their heads! Worth the compromises of being on a boat. 

Simon was a good host and very accommodating. "
"13",760599,103799787,"2016-09-24",14561178,"Katrina","The good things: The house is amazingly located, gorgeous view, big, exactly as described, warm and had a lovely kitchen and shower. When we arrived they gave us wifi codes, maps, a cute personalized booklet for the boat and everything we could need. They even let us store our luggage when we arrived before check in. Simon greater us as well and was very polite.

The bad things: metal stairs go down to the boat and while I was sober I actually slipped quiet a few times. It's a bit dangerous. Also, the bed in the bedroom isn't a double bed, it's two twin beds pressed together and we kept falling through the center several times which was very uncomfortable. Also the 10 minute walk from the hotel where you pick up the keys to the house boat is extremely unpleasant when you have rolling luggage. Also, check in is at 2pm but we arrived at 11am and we were sick and wanted to sleep but they made us wait till 2pm to enter the boat because the cleaning people don't come till 1pm they said to clean it. This made sense. But then when it came time for us to check out they told us check out was 11am so cleaning could come (even though a different front desk lady had told me they always clean that boat everyday at 1pm) so we had to wake up very early and since we were sick on our trip and slept most of it away we wanted to stay those extra two hours before cleaning came at 1pm but they wouldn't let us. I am unsure yet if they charged us for staying 30 min past checkout but if they did I'd be very upset as cleaning doesn't come until 1pm anyway. Other than the check in/out times which were specifically annoying to us cause we were sick and wanted to sleep it was all in all a wonderful experience actually and if you aren't trying to sleep your whole trip you probably won't have any problems at all. :)"

Excellent location (except if noise bothers you, some partiers @ the nearby club can get loud). But waking to swans going by ur window was a good compromise. Simon is a great host & would highly recommend staying. Enjoy!"
"15",760599,112710426,"2016-11-07",77724434,"Hervé","Trés bon emplacement cependant le logement est vétuste, notamment la salle de bain, du fait que ce soit une péniche l'eau de la douche s’écoule très difficilement.
Un rafraîchissement peinture serait la bien venue.
Attention literie mauvaise, le matelas penche de gauche et droite ce qui fait que l'on doit se mettre au centre, pas top!!!

We booked last minute and Simon was very accommodating and instructions for everything are very clear. We would highly recommend this place as it has everything.Last words from my 21 year old niece..'I don't want to leave!!' Thanks Simon, sorry about the keys!!! "

"25",760599,149447264,"2017-05-04",39561643,"Joe","Simon is a very nice man and we had a great time staying on his houseboat.  
The boat is in a great location in the center of town in a fairly busy part of the Amstel River where tourist boats frequently pass.  The boats usually passed by slowly so there wasn't much of a wake or rocking on our boat and we waved to plenty of smiling passers-by. 
It was nice to be so close to things like bike rentals, cafés, grocery stores, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, museums, etc.
Sleeping on the boat was very relaxing.  There was a bit of noise from the occasional siren passing by or some party people whooping it up in the streets, but not enough noise to make the location a deal breaker.  Just enough to remind  you that you're floating on a boat in the Amstel River in the middle of Amsterdam.  It was really cool.
Also, the women we met at the hotel where we picked up and dropped off our key were kind, patient and helpful.   
It was a nice little stroll over a bridge and along a canal to get from the hotel to the boat.
All in all it was a great experience and I feel like we got lucky staying on Simon's boat."
"26",760599,150745956,"2017-05-09",114246051,"Elizabeth","Loved it! Awesome location and as described. Simon was very helpful. We did find some ants in the bedroom and living room. We sprayed with repellent that was there in the cabinets, which took care of it. The only other issue was that the bed in the bedroom is actually two singles, and they'll slip apart in the night. Overall though, really awesome place and would definitely stay again!!!"

"31",760599,204695435,"2017-10-19",136629190,"Linda","Jump aboard and relax in AXO's comfortable environment. We loved the location--so easy to walk to good restaurants, museums (especially the Hermitage, Flower Market, Rembrandt Square) and transportation. I can't imagine being in a better location in the city. Be sure to buy crackers and bread to feed the swans who can poke their heads inside the windows for a handout. Check in advance for a concert or performance at the Center for Opera and Ballet, just across the street."

"34",760599,231641511,"2018-02-02",8462445,"Bryan","Simon was a GREAT host. Since we got in early, both him and the hotel staff were very accommodating. Once arriving at the actual boat, Simon was there to greet us. He recommended what to do during our stay in town. Every time we reached out to him, he responded quickly. I would absolutely stay here again. The house boat was the PERFECT size for the three of us but would be equally perfect for a 4th guest as advertised. Staying on a boat gave us a uniquely authentic feel for the city of Amsterdam. The location was great and it was easy to navigate throughout the city. We really enjoyed ourselves!"

Houseboat was spacious for 3 and our daughter adored feeding the swans and ducks that came up to the window for breakfast every morning.  Definitely made our 4 days in Amsterdam memorable! Easy and fun Green bike rental directly across the street.  Some noise from the Icebar on Friday and Saturday night (also directly across the street) but that’s to be expected.  Loved waking up every morning on the Amstel river! Thanks for a great stay!"

"39",760599,262895642,"2018-05-10",269800,"Aaron","While being on the water is great (we stayed on multiple houseboats during out trip), this boat is overpriced for what you get. 

Issues: 
- Upon entering it smelled terrible (sewage). You had to air it out each time we got home. 
- Although very comfortable, the bed was actually two single beds pushed together which kept coming apart at night. Not ideal for two people. 
- Checkin is at a nearby hotel. Easy if you don't have luggage to do the 7 min walk, but if you need an Uber, then it's an extra cost at checkin and check out to return the keys (and get your deposit back). Extra cost - €20. 
- Poor instructions on bikes. We rented from where he suggested, and locked them where recommended outside boat on the rail but they were stolen (or taken by the city) at a cost of €160. 
- Simon the host was slow or didn't respond a number of times... And when he did, his responses were condescending and not what you'd expect from the reviews we read as they were generally great. Maybe he was just having a bad day :/

With so many great choices in A'dam, we wouldn't stay here again."

The houseboat itself was better than imagined: very spacious, decorated with Asian artifacts, bamboo blinds and green plants that added a tropical touch. There is a bluetooth radio and the kitchen is fully prepared for cooking some light meals. Simon is very responsive and accommodating. He spent time giving tips on the area and showing all the details in the apartment. There were clean towels and ample toiletries. the heat was very comfortable, making it the perfect cozy experience for winter in Amsterdam. I would highly recommend this!"

Everything litteraly perfect but the bed which is not great for a couple (we kept on falling between the two single beds. Except that, there’s nothing wrong to say."
